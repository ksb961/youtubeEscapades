			I am not an expert on children nor do I ever intend to be. Personally I find most of them gross, annoying and fucking gross, but I will say that my nephews have beaten the odds. I’m not sure if it’s because they’re unrealistically cute or that my oldest sister frightened the love into me, but I love them and to be honest I think it’s a bit of both previously mentioned. <Br><Br>It’s a weird feeling meeting someone so small and yet have them mean so much. Like I would fuck a bitch up for my nephews in a heartbeat. I try not to think about it too much because once I start thinking of them getting older, and dating, and what would happen if they date some venti-cup-of-basic drinking skank who cheats on them.<Br><Br> I find myself thinking that that bitch would just go missing one day and I’d end up getting a tattoo of a tear on my cheek soon after.  Well, if we’re being honest it wouldn’t be a tear it would be a saying on my lower back:  “I decided that a bitch needed to get got”.  And then I visualize myself doing time for them and so that’s when I stop thinking about it. I’m tiny and I have a lot of muscle to gain if I’m headed to prison for those midgets. <Br><Br>

				Hello! My name is Tink! <Br> <Br>I am a self taught make up and hair enthusiast! <Br> I've been making videos for youtube since 2014 <Br>but have been fascinated with make up since I was little. <Br> My favourite looks to do are my fantasy / horror make up looks,<Br> I love how creative they can get!  <Br>I also have very successful pixie hair-styling videos and I am constantly<Br> persuading people to cut their hair short haha! <Br> <Br> Please don't be afraid to subscribe to my channel and  <Br>JOIN THE MADNESS: www.youtube.com/xoxoprettybitches  <Br>(or click the red lips found at the top of the page).<Br> And feel free to follow me on my other social media as I do post  <Br>pictures of make up looks I don't film (click all of the lip colours above!). <Br> <Br> I don't like the xoxoprettybitches channel to be thought of as my channel <Br> when I get so much inspiration and ideas from all of you! <Br>I like to think of it as OUR channel and I hope you do too.<Br> I hope you think of our videos as a place to escape when you're having a bad day <Br> or just a boredom killer when you've got some time to spare :) <Br>either way I hope you enjoy the content we make!  <Br> Stay Beautiful Bitches <3 <Br>
